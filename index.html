    <p id="bio">Mickey Mouse is a cartoon character created in 1928 at Walt Disney Animation Studios, who serves as the mascot of the Walt Disney Company. An anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white gloves, Mickey is one of the world's most recognizable fictional characters. He was created by Walt Disney. He has many films but I like his cartoon, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. It was from 2006 to 2016. All of his episodes in Plane crazy were hand drawn as there was no animtion at that time. I like mickey mouse since I was 3 years old. 5-6 of Mickey's cartoons are hand drawn and Mickey Mouse clubhouse is fully animated. It has characters like- Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck & Goofy. The helping hands also help them alot. Mickey's real name is not Mickey Mouse but Mickey Theodore Mouse.</p>
